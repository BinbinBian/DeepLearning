DeepLearning
============

Basic deep learning algorithms and experiments with MNIST, CIFAR, ImageNet.

Different languages: python, c++, java

Python project for deep learning algorithms: rbm, dbn, cnn, 

Motivated and improved based on yusugomori's [Deep Learning implementation](https://github.com/yusugomori/DeepLearning).

What's added:
 - functions: cost function calculation
 - visualiation: iPython Notebook
 - algorithms: cnn
 - dataset: mnist, cifar, imagenet
 - optimization: dropout, low-rank approximization
 - parallelism: GPUs, CPUs (multi-threading), cluster, Sparc, data/feature parallelism
